PHP, JS, CSS, HTML, jQueryMobile

2010 vintage site written initially in PHP in Dreamweaver with subsequent hand coding throughout the site. There is a switch to a mobile version of the site in JS that routes handheld devices to the jQueryMobile version of the site. If I were to do this again, I would build the site in a responisve framework rather than have a separate single page app. The SPA uses PHP of course to to serve the data from the back end into the page as does the desktop version. Some of the files are from earlier versions of the site which used SWF files which we moved from in 2012. 

The connections folder has been removed for security.
